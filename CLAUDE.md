# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new repository that currently contains only Claude Code configuration files. The project structure and commands will be updated as the codebase develops.

## Configuration

- Claude Code permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` to allow basic Bash operations (find, ls)

## Development History and Change Tracking

- Implement a systematic method for tracking changes and maintaining a checkpoint history of modifications
- Ensure detailed logging of code changes, iterations, and key decision points
- Create a mechanism to reference past changes for future review and understanding of project evolution

## Development Best Practices

- Always run tests before considering a task complete
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for new development
